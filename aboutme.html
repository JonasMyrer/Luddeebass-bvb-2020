    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I first started playing guitar when I was three years old, and I was hooked straight away. When I was 16 I bought my first electric guitar.
    I had some lessons for a few month, and have not stopped playing since.</p>
    <p>I've just recently stopped playing in what used to be my band, but my love for music has not diminished. I still practice everyday
    to expand my knowledge, and become a better teacher for the next generation. I love my job!</p>
    <p>When not playing or teaching guitar, I do yoga and exercise with my dogs. </p>
